# Omair Farooqui . Jarvis Consulting

I am a Software Engineer who recently graduated from Ontario Tech University. I am someone who loves to learn and keep expanding my tool belt. I love this field because there is always constant room for growth and Software Engineers are in very high demand with all the tech in the world today. This field is a great place to be in as there as so many different roles and specializations you can consider. I am someone who has always found it easy to deal with the back-end of applications, however I would like to expand my role to Full Stack and learn a modern library like React to help achieve that.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OmairFarooqui](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OmairFarooqui)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OmairFarooqui/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed an application to record the hardware specifications and monitor resources usages (CPU/memory etc) in real-time of each node within a Linux cluster of 10 nodes. These nodes will be running CentOS 7 and connected via switch, allowing them to communicate through internal IPv4 addresses. The data collected will be stored in a PostgreSQL database and used to generate reports for resource planning. The technologies used in this project include Bash (scripts), IntelliJ IDE, Docker, Git, and PostgreSQL.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OmairFarooqui/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: Designed an application which mimics the linux grep command. The purpose of this application is to search through a given directory for any matches to a user-given string and write the found matching strings to a file. The technologies used include: Java 8, IntelliJ IDE, Maven, Docker, and Git.
  - JDBC App: In progress
  - Twitter App: Not started

## Highlighted Projects
**IoT Smart Home Security System**: Led a team consisting of four Software Engineering students to develop a Smart Home Security System. Application offers arm/disarm feature, voice command capability via Amazon Alexa, live video camera footage and capability to record footage. Technologies used include Arduino, Java, C, ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module, PIR Motion Sensor, Android, Firebase, and ArduCAM Mini.

**ElectionBlock, Blockchain-Based Voting System**: Collaborated with a team of four Software Engineering students to develop a permission-based blockchain voting system that integrates a biometric scanner for authentication and proof of authority as a consensus protocol. Developed in Python, the system runs on its own centralized blockchain network. Published under the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture Companion (ICSA-C).

**COVID-19 Tracking Mobile Application**: Collaborated with a team of four Software Engineering students to develop a COVID-19 application that keeps users up- to-date with the latest statistics. The application includes a main page with updated global statistics, the use of Google Maps API to pinpoint a location and display statistics, and a search query function to display statistics for user-specific countries/cities. The application was developed using Android (Java).

**Polling Cloud Web Application**: Developed a polling web application and deployed it to an Amazon EC2 instance (IaaS). The application allows users to create their own polls, vote in any poll made by users, and view results of all polls in a table format. All data is stored and accessible using a MySQL database. The database was setup using Amazon RDS (SaaS). The application was developed using Python, HTML, CSS, Amazon RDS (MySQL), and deployed using Amazon EC2.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2021-present)**: Developed numerous projects which incorporate key characteristics and demanding technical skills of a software developer. This includes using technologies and methodologies like Linux, SQL, Docker, Bash, Java, Python, Agile/Scrum and more.

**Program Assistant, The Village Children's Program (2017-2021)**: Worked with early childhood educators to supervise children aged 4-13, create a safe environment and space for children, ensure the well-being and engagement of children under our supervision, engage with parents of the children to enable trust and good relationships.
